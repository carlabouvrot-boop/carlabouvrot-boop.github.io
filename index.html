  <title>Carla Bouvrot —- Portfolio</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Portfolio of Carla Bouvrot — final-year General Engineering student at ECAM LaSalle Strasbourg-Europe, specializing in Materials and Sustainable Development.
I’m passionate about industrial innovation, project management, and process optimization — fields where technical expertise meets creativity and collaboration.
Currently completing my apprenticeship at Mercedes-Benz Trucks Molsheim, I work within the Customer Tailored Trucks (CTT) department, where I help optimize business processes, define KPIs, and support project execution to improve efficiency and competitiveness.
Through international experiences in Norway and Israel, I’ve developed a strong adaptability and an open-minded approach to engineering challenges. I enjoy working on multidisciplinary projects that bring together design, data, and human factors to create meaningful, sustainable solutions.
Driven by curiosity and a desire to make things better, I aim to build a career that bridges technical excellence, continuous improvement, and real-world impact." />

            <h3>Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa — 2022-2023</h3>
            <p>
             Spending a semester at Technion in Haifa was one of the most formative experiences of my studies.  
            I joined the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, where I strengthened my technical skills in mechanical design, thermodynamics, and materials science through hands-on projects and laboratory work.  
            Living in a multicultural city — where Jewish, Arab, and international communities coexist — taught me to adapt quickly, communicate across cultures, and appreciate diverse perspectives.  
            Beyond academics, daily life in Israel was a lesson in independence: navigating administrative challenges, discovering unique traditions like Shabbat, and experiencing a completely new rhythm of life.  
            This exchange deeply enhanced my open-mindedness, resilience, and ability to thrive in international and multidisciplinary environments.

            <h3>UIT The Arctic University of Norway, Narvik — 2024</h3>
            <p>
             Immersed in a Nordic approach to <strong>sustainable engineering</strong> that combines technical precision with environmental responsibility.  
            Courses and projects focused on <strong>renewable energy, life-cycle analysis, Lean methods, and Industry 4.0</strong>, fostering a mindset where efficiency and sustainability go hand in hand.  
            Surrounded by the Arctic landscapes of Northern Norway, I learned how nature and engineering coexist — how every design choice must respect resources, endure harsh climates, and remain simple yet durable.  
            This experience deepened my commitment to <strong>eco-design and pragmatic innovation</strong>, where long-term impact matters more than short-term performance.
